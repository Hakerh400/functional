**Functional()** is an esoteric Turing complete programming language.<br/>
Online interpreter can be found [here](https://hakerh400.github.io/?project=functional%28%29).

# How to run

Navigate to the `example` directory and run the following command:

```
node main.js -src <source file name>
```

where `<source file name>` is the name of the file from `examples` subdirectory you want to run.<br/>
For example: `node main.js -src addition`

The program reads from the `input.txt` file and writes to the `output.txt` file.
